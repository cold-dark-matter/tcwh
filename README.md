This repository contains the code to reproduce the results of the paper " Effect of higher-order interactions on tipping cascades on complex networks". All the codes are listed with their respective figure numbers. Fig. 7 can be reproduced by just changing the parameters in the provided codes. 
414.edges and 3980.edges are the two edgelists used to construct the social networks on which tipping cascades are simulated.
